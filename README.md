# Crafting_System

## This Project is a basic Crafting System built into Unreal Engine 5, meant to simulate the crafting system of an action adventure video game.

This project is meant to be a *learning and practical* execution of a crafting system for myself and a guide to others to implement something similar into their games/projects. The following project has these features:

  1. A basic inventory with its own UI to view items
  2. The ability to pickup items from the ground
  3. A crafting system that allows items to be created as long as the necessary components are acquired
  4. Basic items with their own categories that are separated in the inventory system UI
